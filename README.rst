Kayobe-Config-Docker
####################

A WIP jenkins setup to run kayobe commands from a seed host.

How to use
----------
First add the contents of the `kayobe-docker` directory
to the root of your Kayobe-Config repo like so::
    kayobe_config/
    ├── Dockerfile
    ├── Jenkinsfile
    ├── docker-entrypoint.sh

Don't forget to add and commit the changes to the branch
you wish to deploy.

Next, edit the contents of jenkins_config (if necessary)
and ensure the following:

 * The location url in `jenkins.yaml` should match the seed IP:
    ``url: "http://192.168.33.5/"``

 * The url and branch lines of the pipeline script should match 
   the Kayobe-Config repo (and branch) you wish to deploy::
    url('https://github.com/Wasaac/a-universe-from-nothing')
    branch('*/monasca-stein-dockerise')

Deploying
---------
Copy or clone this repo (with your changes) onto a Kayobe
seed node and run ``jenkins_setup.sh`` as a user with both sudo
and docker privileges.

TODO
####

Replace setup script with ansible playbook and template jenkins config.
